We participate in both subtasks: Span Identification (SI) and Technique Classification (TC). We use a bi-LSTM architecture in the SI subtask and train a complex ensemble model for the TC subtask. Our architectures are built using embeddings from BERT in combination with additional lexical features and extensive label post-processing. Our systems achieve a rank of 8 out of 36 teams in the SI subtask (F1-score: 43.86\%) and 8 out of 31 teams in the TC subtask (F1-score: 57.37\%).",

In the first task, systems are asked to identify specific text spans in a free text where propaganda is being applied. In the second task, systems are asked to identify the propaganda technique being applied in a text span. We describe the construction of the evaluation framework (dataset and evaluation metrics) as well as the approaches explored by the different participants. ",
