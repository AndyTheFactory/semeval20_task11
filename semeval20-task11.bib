By furthering the unsupervised pre-training of the standard BERT model, we specialize the model on propagandistic and hyperpartisan news articles, allowing it to find better representations for the two subtasks - propaganda span detection and propaganda technique classification. Our proposed system achieved in subtask SI a F1 score of 46.06\%, ranking 5th in the leaderboard and for subtask TC an overall F1 average of 54.302\% ranking 19th from 32 teams.",

Our solution proposes a sequential approach in which the span identification is preceded by an ensemble sentence level classifier (SLC).We only perform span identification on those samples which are flagged as propaganda samples by the SLC Model. We perform token level classification by fine-tuning BERT and use CRF to perform sequence tagging. Additionally, we present our analysis on different voting ensembles for the SLC model. Our system ranks 14th on the test set and 22nd on the development set and with an F1 score of 0.41 and 0.39 respectively.",

Our architectures are built using embeddings from BERT in combination with additional lexical features and extensive label post-processing. Our systems achieve a rank of 8 out of 36 teams in the SI subtask (F1-score: 43.86\%) and 8 out of 31 teams in the TC subtask (F1-score: 57.37\%).",

The goal of the SI task is to identify specific fragments of each article which contain the use of at least one propaganda technique. This is a binary sequence tagging task. We tested several approaches finally selecting a fine-tuned BERT model as our baseline model. Our main contribution is an investigation of several unsupervised data augmentation techniques based on distributional semantics expanding the original small training dataset as applied to this BERT-based sequence tagger. We show that, although increases in F1 score are not significant, usage of some expansion strategies can lead to discrete improvements in precision and recall.",

abstract = "This paper presents the winning system for the propaganda Technique Classification (TC) task and the second-placed system for the propaganda Span Identification (SI) task. The purpose of TC task was to identify an applied propaganda technique given propaganda text fragment. The goal of SI task was to find specific text fragments which contain at least one propaganda technique. Both of the developed solutions used semi-supervised learning technique of self-training. Interestingly, although CRF is barely used with transformer-based language models, the SI task was approached with RoBERTa-CRF architecture. An ensemble of RoBERTa-based models was proposed for the TC task, with one of them making use of Span CLS layers we introduce in the present paper. In addition to describing the submitted systems, an impact of architectural decisions and training schemes is investigated along with remarks regarding training models of the same or better quality with lower computational budget. Finally, the results of error analysis are presented.",

The predictions of RoBERTa were further fine-tuned by class-dependent-minority-class classifiers. A special classifier, which employs dynamically adapted Least Common Sub-sequence algorithm, is used to adapt to the intricacies of repetition class.
